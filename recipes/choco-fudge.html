  <img src="../images/choco-fudge.jpg" alt="choco-fudge">

  <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through the family. It's better than any
    fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore and easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>
    <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped nuts</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil; set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine sugar, marshmallow cream, evaporated milk, butter, and salt together in a large saucepan over medium
      heat; bring to a full boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and add milk chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips; stir until chocolate is melted and
      mixture is smooth. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Pour into prepared pan; chill in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until
      firm.</li>
  </ol>
